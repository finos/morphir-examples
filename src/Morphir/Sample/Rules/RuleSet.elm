corresponds to a fact in the fact set in traditional rule engine terms.

{-| A rule set is represented as a list of partial functions. Each entry in the rule set is
created using the same helper function that turns the list of predicates into a single predicate
and also specifies the output of the rule. This provides an easy to read tabular format for
the rule set while still supporting very complex matching rules if needed.

Using the power of functional programming we can go beyond simple exact matches and apply more
complex matching rules such as `noneOf`, `anyOf` or `startsWith` directly in the decision table.

make rule definition easier and cleaner by using either a specific value to match against or a predicate
function for flexibility.
