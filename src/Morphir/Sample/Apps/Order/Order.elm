{-| Order price can either be market or limit. 
  * Market will take the current market price at the time the order is processed.
  * Limit takes the specific price that is supplied. 

This kind OR relationship between types is difficult to express in most OOP languages.
Enums come close to it but if the types are different structurally an enum cannot model 
that. In this example one type has no extra info while the other has a Price value 
associated to it. This happens very frequently in our domain and not having a direct way 
to model it creates a lot of friction.  
-}
type OrderPrice
    = Market
    | Limit Price


{-| Type aliases are great when you want to defer a decision about the structure of a value.
In this example we knew that we needed an order request ID and that we might need to structure 
it in a certain way in the future but for now we just want to model it as a string. If we just
used a string in our models we would have lost thhis information and changing to a different 
type would also require changes in many places. With an alias you can change the type right here 
and will be applied everywhere where it's used.
-}
type alias ID = String 


{-| An order request is modeled using a record type which is almost like a POJO but it's immutable
and automatically defines equality by comparing all fields. This makes records ideal for messaging.
-}
type alias Request a =
    { a | id: ID
    , requestPrice : OrderPrice
    }


type alias BuyRequest = Request
    { quantity : Quantity
    , product : Product.ID
    }


type alias SellRequest = Request
    { dealId : String
    }


{-| Union types are great for modeling the different kind of violations that we can capture in our 
validation rules. Just as before we do more than just enums since the different violations are structurally
different.
-}
type Violations
    = InvalidPrice Price
    | InvalidQuantity Quantity


{-| In this example we thought that differentiating validation errors from rejections due to business
reasons is usefult so we captured them in a separate type.
-}
type RejectReason
    = InsufficientInventory
    | DisagreeablePrice


{-| Union types are great for modeling results too. Here we have 3 different types of results.
An order can be:
  * Accepted if everything goes well, or
  * Invalid if a validation rule was violated, or
  * Rejected if the order was valid but we didn't accpt it for business reasons.
-}
type BuyResponse
    = BuyAccepted ID Product.ID Price Quantity
    | BuyInvalid ID (List Violations)
    | BuyRejected ID (List RejectReason)


type SellResponse 
    = SellAccepted ID Price


-- Our own representation of a Deal to avoid tight coupled dependency on BooksAndRecords in core logic
type alias Deal =
    { id : ID
    , product : Product.ID
    , price : Price
    , quantity : Quantity
    }

        BuyAccepted id _ _ _ -> id

{-| Validation takes in the order request and retuns a list of violations. An empty list of violations 
means the order request is valid.
-}
validate : BuyRequest -> List Violations
validate request =
    let 
        priceCheck =

                    if 
                        p < 0

            else
                []

{-| This is where modeling request price as a union pays off. We don't have to handle invalid states
like a limit request without a price or a market request with a price defined. We can focus on handling
requests that are valid from a business perspective which means that there is less noise and the code
becomes more readable.

the order request was accepted.
